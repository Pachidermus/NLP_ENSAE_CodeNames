    "Games are increasingly used as fields to apply Natural Language Processing techniques. *Codenames* is a popular Czech board game which is based on similarity between words. Two teams compete, each team having one \"codemaster\" and one or several guessers. 25 words (codename tiles) are placed on the table. The role of the guessers is to find their teamâ€™s words, while avoiding the words belonging to the other team, to the assassin or to civilian squares. The guessers give their answers based on single-word clues given by the spymaster. \n",

    "While heuristics used for our bots differ quite strongly depending on their basis, guessers and codemasters tend to follow the same philosophy:\n",
    "* Codemasters try to give valuable clues that connect to several words from their team while avoiding words from the enemy team and the assassin.\n",
    "* Guessers order their guesses based on a similarity measured between the clue and available words. Most of the time, they try to guess the exact number of words indicated by the codemaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact, our algorithm all suffer from the same problems when compared to humans:\n",
    "* They **don't remember previous plays** and act blindly to what happened earlier. This means that codemasters may end up giving the exact same clue twice in a row if the guessers didn't find its associated words during the first try. Also, guessers won't remember their mistakes and won't try to guess the words that they previously missed.\n",
    "* Our bots **don't really pay attention to what the enemy team is doing** and only care about the number of enemy cards that have been revealed. More importantly, guessers from a team do not try to understand what the enemy clue might have meant for their guessers. \n",

Finally, we monitor the **frequency of the assassins** in our games. Calling the assassin is something that occurs rather rarely when playing with humans, and we would like our algorithms to avoid calling the assassin as it less exciting for the other team to win in such a manner.

    "It seems pretty clear that the **average number of turn (with or without assassin) decreases as greed increases**, meaning that codemasters take more risk by trying to give clue associated to more words. However, a quite surprising result is that the **ratio of assassin calls doesn't increase in an uniform fashion**. We would have expected our greediest algorithm to call assassins more often but it is not exactly the case. Still, one may observe that the safest bot almost never called the assassin compared to others.  \n",

    "Generally speaking, in both games, **codemasters grow greedier as the game progresses**. They start by trying to make their teammates guess 2 words, and increase their expectations to 3 or 4 words in late-mid game (if enough words are remaining). As a consequence, first clues make more sense to humans than the last ones. For instance, the second clue given in both games was *'pakistan 2'* for *'china'* and '*india*', which are all countries located on the same continent. However, in the first game, one of the clue given by red team in late-mid game was *'trained'* for *'laser'*, *'horse'*, *'carrot'*. The relationship between the clue and this combination of words appears hard to understand for us. Since the AI codemasters get greedier as the game progresses, the distance between the clue given and the combination of words to be guessed also tends increase in average. Therefore, it also leads to more mistakes by the guesser. Indeed, in the first game, the first mistake happened late in the game (at turn 5), with guess *'pumkin'* for clue *'religious 4'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to see that even from the very first turn, **GloVe and Word2Vec bots do not make identical guesses** : in both game, the first clue was *'teacher 2'*. In both games, the guessers' first answer turn were identical. However, for this clue, the Word2Vec guesser gave *'flute'* (a correct word) as a second answer whereas GloVe guesser gave *'scientist'*, calling an enemy word. In total, 4 guesses mistakes were made in the first game whereas in the second game, 6 mistakes were made. A mistake was already made at the second turn in the second game, while no mistakes were made before turn 5 in the first game. Those elements suggest that Word2Vec codemaster works better with a Word2Vec guesser and the same observation can be stated for GloVe bots. Indeed, as Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings have distinct latent spaces, using bots with different embeddings in a team leads to more mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the first game lasted 9 turns and the winner was the red team, whereas the second game lasted 8 turns and the winner was the blue team. It seems that the duet (`CodemasterW2V`, `GuesserGlove`) performs worse than the duet (`CodemasterGlove, GuesserW2V`) in this specific game example."

    "We previously showed that the average number of turns for games with no assassin called is 8,5. This game lasted 8 turns, which is a bit lower than this average. The bot guesser made 2 mistakes (civilians only). Our human guesser made one more mistake : 3 guesses were civilian words. Actually, the fact that both AI players are based on a similar word embedding makes it easier for the AI codemaster and the AI guesser to understand each other. Nevertheless, some choices opted by the GloVe codemaster seem rather smart, for example choosing the clue *'soap 2'* to make its teammate guess *'watch'* and *'opera'*.\n",

    "Moreover, AIs do not make \"silly\" mistakes. In this game, the human codemaster gave the clue *'holidays 2'*, thinking of making the other human player guess *'greece'* and *'club'*, not noticing that the civilian word *'trip'* is the one that makes the most sense given the clue. Besides, we did not allow our bots to take into account past guesses or past clues, contrary to real human players. Since the human guesser was not able to find team words with the clue *'holidays'*, the human codemaster changed the clue to *'resort 2'* in order to make it more understandable to the guesser. Our bots are not able to modulate their answers depending on the other team player's reaction, however."

    "Using various NLP techniques, we managed to implement bots playing different types of players, which are codemaster and guesser. We compared the use of word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe with methods based upon synsets. We exploited metrics such as the cosine distance or the Wu-Palmer similarity to build those bots. We also tried to take into account game environment to some extent, adding weights and greed parameters to our AI players. Our **final bots make guesses and clues which generally make sense** to us and they are able to play against - or with - humans. The benchmark results suggest that bots based on the use of hypernyms (first version of WordNet bots) are the worst performing ones, whereas the best ones are those based on GloVe embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Several improvements may be added** to our bots. First of all, as computing time would explode otherwise, we had to put a constraint on the the vocabulary size of the codemaster. A wider vocabulary could be used with proper optimizations of the current code. The second WordNet codemaster is especially time-consuming. For similar reasons, we could not execute a high number of games with different bots or different parameters values. We had to limit ourselves to only five different teams in our benchmark, which is good but does not allow to explore all possibilities. In addition, our bots do not take into account different aspects of game progress. As a consequence, our bots could not modulate their answers depending on the past guesses or clues, either from their own team or the enemy team. Adding this feature would allow reinforcing our bots and make their behavior more human-like. Finally, our implementation only allows teams of two players. To be able to run a game with several guessers in the same team, one solution may be to proceed to a majority poll system to decide for a team's final guesses.\n",
